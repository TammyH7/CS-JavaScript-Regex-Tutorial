# Matching an Email Regex: A Breakdown Analysis of Its Components

## Introduction

Regular expressions, commonly known as regex, are powerful tools for pattern matching and validation in various programming and scripting languages in the field of Computer Science. In this tutorial, we will delve into the components of the regex for matching an email address, dissecting each element to understand its role in validating a specific email address format. Upon completing the tutorial, readers will have a clear comprehension and understanding of regex components regarding matching an email address to ensure accurate and reliable email validation.

## Summary

Regular expressions are a way to describe patterns in a string of data. They form a small language of their own, which is a part of many programming languages like JavaScript. Regular expressions allow you to check a string of characters like an e-mail address or password for patterns to see if they match the pattern defined by that regular expression and produce actionable information.

Throughout this tutorial, the featured regular expression (regex) as seen below, will be referenced for each component to understand what it means. The regex components discussed in this document include: anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, and character escapes.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

In a regular expression (regex), anchors are used to specify the position in the input string where a match must occur. There are two main types of anchors: the caret ^ and the dollar sign $.

<strong>Caret ^: Start of String Anchor:</strong>

This anchor asserts that the following regex pattern must appear at the beginning of the string.

Example:
`/^`

<strong>Dollar sign $: End of String Anchor</strong>

This anchor asserts that the preceding regex pattern must appear at the end of the string.

Example:
`$/`

For validating email addresses using regex, anchors are commonly used to ensure that the regex pattern matches the entire email address and not just a part of it.

Example:

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

In this example, the `^` anchor specifies that the pattern must start at the beginning of the string, and the `$` anchor specifies that the pattern must end at the end of the string. This ensures that the entire string is a valid email address.

### Quantifiers

The qualifiers are the characters that add specific conditions or constraints to the pattern. Here's a breakdown of the qualifiers in this regex:

Given the regex `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`:

1. Quantifier `+` : Matches "one or more" occurrences.
   - `([a-z0-9_\.-]+)`: Matches one or more lowercase letters, digits, underscores, dots, or hyphens.
   - `([\da-z\.-]+)`: Matches one or more digits, lowercase letters, dots, or hyphens.

2. Quantifier `{2,6}` : Matches between 2 and 6 occurrences.
   - `([a-z\.]{2,6})`: Matches a sequence of 2 to 6 lowercase letters or dots.

So, in the context of this regex, the qualifiers ensure certain conditions for the email pattern are being met as shown below:
- One or more lowercase letters, digits, underscores, dots, or hyphens
- Followed by the `@` symbol
- Followed by one or more digits, lowercase letters, dots, or hyphens
- Followed by a period
- Ending with a two to six letter top-level domain (e.g., .com, .edu, .co.uk)

Here is an example of an email address that matches the pattern of the qualifiers and their conditions: user123@example.com

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs are represented by parentheses `()` . Grouping constructs are used in regular expressions to define and capture portions of the matched text. They allow you to treat part of the pattern as a single unit and can be helpful for various purposes including:
- Capturing substrings for later use 
- Applying quantifiers to a specific group of characters
- Creating backreference for previously matched group.

In our regex example,  `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`, there are  (3) defined grouping constructs shown within  the parentheses `()` symbol. Each group represents different sections of the email address. These sections include:
 1. Local-Part: `([a-z0-9_\.-]+)`
 2. Domain: `([a-z0-9_\.-]+)`
 3. Top-level Domain: `([a-z\.]{2,6})`

Now, let's take a look at each section in detail to understand its functionality:

**1. Local Part**

The local part of a regular expression for an email address typically refers to the portion of the email address that comes `before the @` symbol. In the context of email address validation using regular expressions, the local part is the part that includes the **username** or **account name** of the email address.

`([a-z0-9_\.-]+)`: The local part is represented by the first grouping construct. This allows for a combination of the following characters:
* Lowercase letters: `a-z`
* Numbers: `0-9`
* Underscores: `_`
* Dots: `.`
* Hyphens: `-`

The local part ensures that there is at least one character in the local part or **username** of the email address.

In a typical email address like `username@1_example.com`, the local part would be `username`. The regular expression is designed to validate and extract this part from the overall email address pattern.

**2. Domain:**

The domain part of a regular expression for an email address typically refers to the portion of the email address that comes `after the @ `symbol but before the top-level domain (TLD). In the context of email address validation using regular expressions, the domain part includes the **mail server domain name**.


`([\da-z\.-]+)`: The domain part is represented by the second grouping construct. This part ensures that there is at least one of the following group of characters in the domain name: 
* It contains lowercase letters:  `example`
* It contains numbers: `1`
* It contains a dot: `.`
* It contains a hyphen: `-`

In a typical email address like `username@1_example.com`, the domain part would be `1_example`. The regular expression is designed to validate and extract this part from the overall email address pattern.

**3. Top-level Domain:**

The top-level domain (TLD) part of a regular expression for an email address refers to the portion that comes `after the last dot (period)` in the domain part of the email address. In the context of email address validation using regular expressions, the top-level domain (TLD) represents the highest level of the domain hierarchy and often indicates the type or purpose of the domain.

This helps to ensure that only the valid top-level domains are accepted and matches between `2` to `6` characters that can be:
* Lowercase letters: `a-z`
* Dots: `.`

In a typical email address like "username@1_example.com," the TLD part would be `com`. The use of `{2,6}` ensures that the TLD is between 2 and 6 characters long, which is a common range for TLDs in practice and matches for the following reasons:

* It contains lowercase letters: `com`
* It has a length of 3 characters, which falls within the valid range of `2` to `6` characters.

`([a-z\.]{2,6})`: The regex pattern  effectively captures the top-level domain portion of the email address by allowing a combination of lowercase letters and dots, with a length constraint of between 2 to 6 characters.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions are used to define a character class, which is a set of characters enclosed within square brackets `[]`. A character class matches any single character from the set it represents. In the regular expression example of: `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`, there are several bracket expressions that define character classes. Here is a break down the relevant parts:

`[a-z0-9_\.-]`: This is a character class that matches any single character that is a lowercase letter `(a-z)`, digit `(0-9)`, underscore `(_)`, dot `.`, or hyphen `-`.

`[\da-z\.-]`: This is another character class that matches any single character that is a digit `(\d)`, lowercase letter `(a-z),` dot `.`, or hyphen `-`.

`[a-z\.]`: This character class matches any single character that is a lowercase letter or a dot `.`.

### Character Classes

Character classes, known as character sets, are a short and more concise regular expressions (regex) that represent specific sets of characters. Through the use of character classes, you can simplify and shorten regex patterns, thereby making them readable and easier to understand.

**1. Character Classes and Character Sets:**
The featured email regex uses the primary character class: `\d` and `..` Character sets are defined within square brackets, such as `[a-z]`, `[0-9]`, and `[.-]`. These sets represent multiple characters, allowing a single character match from the specified range.

`/[a-zA-Z0-9]/`: These character classes are used in the regular expression to define valid characters for different parts of an email address. 

**2. Metacharacters Inside Character Classes:** 
The metacharacters are characters with special meanings in regex, such as the dot `(.)`. Inside character classes, some metacharacters lose their special meaning and are treated as literals. In our featured email regex, the hyphen `(-)` and the dot `(.)` are metacharacters placed inside character classes `[a-z0-9_.-]` and `[\da-z.-]`. The dot (.) does not need to be escaped with a backslash, and the hyphen is used as a literal character without escaping, as it is placed at the beginning or end of the character set.

Character classes provide a way to make regular expressions more flexible and expressive by allowing a pattern to match a variety of characters at a specific position in the text being matched.

### Flags

 Flags are optional parameters that can be added to the pattern to modify its behavior. Flags are typically specified after the closing delimiter of the regex (often a forward slash `/`), and they influence how the pattern is interpreted or applied. Different programming languages and tools that support regex may have different sets of flags. Here are (2) examples of some common ones:

**1. Case Insensitivity (i)**: This flag makes the pattern case-insensitive, meaning it will match both uppercase and lowercase letters without distinction. For example, /pattern/i would match "Pattern," "PATTERN," "pattern," etc.

**2. Global (g)**: This flag is used for global matching, meaning it will find all matches in the input string rather than stopping after the first match. 

In JavaScript, flags are often specified as a string after the closing delimiter (e.g., /pattern/gi), while in some other languages, they are passed as separate parameters to a regex constructor or function.

### Character Escapes

Character escapes are an essential aspect of a regular expression, allowing for accurate pattern matching by suppressing the special meaning of metacharacters and representing characters that cannot be directly typed. An example of such a character escape, is the **backslash**.

**Backslash**: 
The backslash is a common escape character used to treat metacharacters as literals in regular expressions. Throughout our regex example, the dot `(.)` is escaped with a backslash, exactly like this `\.`. Thus ensuring the dot is treated as a literal period instead of a metacharacter with no distinct meaning.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the provided regex is a comprehensive tool for validating email addresses based on a specific format. By breaking down each component, we can appreciate how the regex ensures that the username, domain, and top-level domain adhere to the specified criteria. Understanding such regular expressions is crucial for developers and system administrators involved in data validation and verification processes, contributing to the robustness and accuracy of their applications.
